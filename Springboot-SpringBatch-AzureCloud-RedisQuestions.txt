Here’s a detailed set of technical interview questions for evaluating a Java developer on Spring Boot, Spring Batch, Azure Cloud, and Redis. These questions aim to assess both conceptual understanding and practical experience.

Spring Boot Questions

	1.	What is Spring Boot and how does it simplify Spring application development?
	2.	Explain how Spring Boot autoconfiguration works. How would you disable a specific autoconfiguration class?
	3.	What are profiles in Spring Boot? How can you manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using profiles?
	4.	How do you handle exception management in Spring Boot? Explain using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.
	5.	What is the role of application.properties or application.yml in Spring Boot? How would you externalize configuration values?
	6.	How do you secure a Spring Boot application using Spring Security? Give an example of a basic security configuration.
	7.	Explain the difference between a @RestController and a @Controller in Spring Boot. When would you use one over the other?
	8.	How does Spring Boot handle database configuration? What is DataSourceAutoConfiguration, and how can you override default database settings?
	9.	What is Actuator in Spring Boot? Name a few endpoints provided by Spring Boot Actuator and explain their purpose.
	10.	How would you implement asynchronous functionality in a Spring Boot application?

Spring Batch Questions

	1.	What is Spring Batch and when would you use it?
	2.	Can you describe the architecture of Spring Batch? What are the key components of a batch job?
	3.	What is a Job, Step, ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter in Spring Batch? Explain with an example.
	4.	How does Spring Batch handle transaction management? What happens if a step fails?
	5.	Explain the difference between Chunk-Oriented Processing and Tasklet in Spring Batch. When would you use each?
	6.	How do you configure a batch job using XML or Java configuration in Spring Batch? Which one do you prefer and why?
	7.	What are job parameters in Spring Batch, and how can you use them to control job execution?
	8.	How would you implement partitioning in Spring Batch to process large datasets in parallel?
	9.	What is Spring Batch Restartability, and how does the framework support restarting failed jobs?
	10.	How would you schedule a Spring Batch job using Spring Scheduler or an external scheduler like Quartz?

Azure Cloud Questions

	1.	What are the key services in Azure that you have used to deploy and manage Java Spring Boot applications?
	2.	How would you deploy a Spring Boot application to Azure App Services? What are the steps involved?
	3.	What is Azure Blob Storage? How would you integrate Azure Blob Storage with a Spring Boot application to upload and download files?
	4.	How does Azure Key Vault work, and how can you use it to manage secrets in your Spring Boot application?
	5.	What is Azure Active Directory (AAD)? How would you implement OAuth2.0 authentication using AAD in a Spring Boot application?
	6.	How would you use Azure Service Bus in a Spring Boot application for message-based communication?
	7.	What is Azure Application Insights? How would you use it to monitor your Spring Boot application?
	8.	How do you set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines in Azure DevOps for a Spring Boot application?
	9.	What is Azure Functions, and how would you integrate it with a Spring Boot application for event-driven processing?
	10.	Explain how you would scale a Spring Boot application deployed on Azure. What are the factors to consider for horizontal or vertical scaling?

Redis Questions

	1.	What is Redis, and how does it differ from traditional relational databases?
	2.	How would you integrate Redis with a Spring Boot application to implement caching?
	3.	What is Redis Pub/Sub? Explain how you would use it for real-time messaging in a Spring Boot application.
	4.	How does Redis handle persistence, and what are the different persistence options available (RDB, AOF)?
	5.	Explain how Redis manages data in-memory. What are the implications of this for performance and scalability?
	6.	How would you implement Redis as a session store in a Spring Boot application?
	7.	What are Redis data types, and how would you use them in various application use cases (e.g., String, Hash, List, Set, Sorted Set)?
	8.	How would you implement Redis-based distributed locking in a Spring Boot application? Why is distributed locking needed?
	9.	What is the Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster? How do they help with high availability and scaling?
	10.	How would you monitor and optimize Redis performance in a production environment? What metrics would you track?

These questions are designed to evaluate a candidate’s depth of knowledge in various key technologies while also touching upon real-world use cases and best practices.
