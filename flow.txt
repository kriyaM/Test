	3.	Iterate Each Row
	4.	Check if Valid Customer
	•	No → Reject File → End
	•	Yes → Check Agreement Status
	5.	Check if Agreement is Present
	•	No → Reject Agreement → End
	•	Yes → Check HIPAA Compliance
	6.	Check if HIPAA Compliant

	10.	Check for Next Record

	•	Yes → Loop back to iterate next record
	•	No → Generate Reports

	11.	Send Mail Based on Reports

I’ll generate a visual flowchart for you.
